**SeaBay** is a comprehensive online marketplace dedicated to buying and selling boats. Whether you're looking for a small sailboat or a luxury yacht, SeaBay connects sellers and buyers with ease. The application supports full CRUD functionality for boat listings and offers, ensuring a seamless user experience for all your boating needs.

## Background

SeaBay was conceived out of a shared passion for boating between the collaborators. We wanted to create a platform that makes it easier for enthusiasts like us to buy and sell boats, no matter the size or location. The project was built using the MERN stack, leveraging our expertise in modern web development to deliver a robust, scalable solution.
